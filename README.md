# Spotify Analytics App

This is an app I built to experiment with Spotipy, which is an easy to use Python library for the Spotify API. In addition to the OTB functionality of searching and queuing songs in your Spotify app, I extended the functionality to include some cool scripts for analyzing the audio features of different music. including:

- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Loudness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Time Signature
- Valence
